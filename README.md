# Disease Prediction System Using Symptoms Based on Machine Learning Algorithm

## Overview
The **Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms. Developed as a final-year project by students at Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering & Technology, this system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide accurate, accessible, and privacy-respecting diagnostic support, particularly for rural and underserved regions. The system achieves up to **98% accuracy** using the Random Forest algorithm and offers a user-friendly Flask-based GUI for seamless interaction.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 98% prediction accuracy using Random Forest, outperforming traditional systems (80–87%).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Flask-based web GUI with dropdown menus for symptom selection, accessible to non-technical users.
- **Broad Disease Coverage**: Predicts 41 diseases based on 128 symptoms.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Delivers instant results with confidence scores.
- **Offline Functionality**: Runs locally, ensuring data privacy and usability in areas with limited internet.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture supports future enhancements like multilingual support and wearable integration.
- **Cost-Effective**: Built with open-source tools, requiring minimal hardware (4GB RAM, Intel i3 or higher).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**:
  - Minimum: Intel Core i3, 4GB RAM, 40GB HDD/SSD
  - Recommended: Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD
- **Software**:
  - Operating System: Windows 7/8/10/11, Ubuntu 18.04+, or macOS 11+
  - Python 3.9 or higher
  - Web Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge

### Python Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using the following `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.2.2
flask==2.3.2
matplotlib==3.7.1
seaborn==0.12.2
scipy==1.10.1
```

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure the dataset files (`Training_No_STDs.csv`, `disease_health_tips.csv`) are placed in the project directory.
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage
1. **Home Page**: Access the main interface with options for symptom checking, diet suggestions, care locator, and quick relief.
2. **Symptom Checker**:
   - Enter your name and select up to six symptoms from dropdown menus.
   - Submit to receive a predicted disease, confidence scores, and tailored health tips.
   - View bar and pie charts visualizing prediction distribution.
3. **Care Near You**: Input your location to find nearby hospitals or clinics.
4. **Diet Suggestion & Quick Relief**: Access curated health tips and remedies.

## Project Structure
- **app.py**: Main Flask application handling routes and hospital finder functionality.
- **prediction.py**: Contains machine learning models, prediction logic, and chart generation.
- **index.html**: Home page template with links to core features.
- **static/**: Stores CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos.
- **templates/**: HTML templates for rendering web pages.
- **Training_No_STDs.csv**: Dataset with 4921 records, 128 symptoms, and 41 diseases.
- **disease_health_tips.csv**: Health tips for predicted diseases.

## Machine Learning Models
The system uses three supervised learning models:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Splits data using Gini Index (max depth: 10).
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Ensemble of 100 decision trees, achieving 98% accuracy.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Fast and effective for binary symptom data.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Replaced with 0 (absence of symptom).
- **Symptom Severity Weighting**: Applied weights (1–7) based on clinical relevance.
- **Label Encoding**: Converted disease labels to numerical values.
- **Normalization**: Standardized features for better model convergence.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 98% (Random Forest)
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: High scores across all models.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized disease-wise performance.
